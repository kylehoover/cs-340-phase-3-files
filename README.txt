Emulators: It's designed for the Nexus 10 tablet, but runs best on the WXGA 10.1 tablet. It also runs well on the Pixel C, but the layout is a little stretched. We used the Android 6.0 Marshmallow API 23 x86 image with our emulators.

Running the app: At the top of the login screen put the server's IP address and port number (e.g. 10.0.2.2:8081 if you're using an emulator)
